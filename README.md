# JarGame
A simple Jar Game where the user is asked to guess the correct number of items that are in the jar.  
The game starts off by asking the administrator of the game to specify the name and the maximum number of items in th jar.  
It then asks the user/player to guess the number of itms in the jar.  It will keep asking the user to make guesses, 
until the user makes the right guess. When the user makes a correct guess, the game will congraulate the user and inform them of the number of 
attepmts they made.  The game does not accept numbers greater than the maximum number of items that the jar can hold.
